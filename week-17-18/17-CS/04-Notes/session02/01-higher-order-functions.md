# Higher-order functions

## Demo

- Open [11-Ins_Higher-Order-Functions/index.js](../../01-Activities/11-Ins_Higher-Order-Functions/index.js)
  - We've been using these throughout, this is just a formality.
- Open [13-Ins_Closures/index.js](../../01-Activities/13-Ins_Closures/index.js)
  - Notice the `console.dir`. You can look that up.
  - Notice that the function itself is also an object.
  - Notice `checking` and `savings` are undefined.
  - Why is `displayFunds` called a closure?
